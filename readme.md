# Scripts:

This file has the script that I used to aid my GRE prep. The functions of the repo include:

## 1. Union all the words from the different sources
I found many sources for "List of GRE words", I wanted to combine all of them without repetition. So I made a csv file that has all the words and made them unique in the jupyter notebook

## 2. Get the definitons

Used [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to get the definitions of all the words. Once I got the definitions it was easy to make a dataframe of words and their corresponding list of dictionaries
